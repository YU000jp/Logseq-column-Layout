### Linked Reference
#### Suitable for [Logseq-Omnivore plugin](https://github.com/omnivore-app/logseq-omnivore) üö©
- Omnivore is a **webclipping tool** that can be quoted to Logseq.
- You can see the table of contents of the web clips next to the journal, so it's easy to access.
#### As a list for inclusion in the next journal üìÖ
 - Use [Logseq datenlp plugin](https://github.com/hkgnp/logseq-datenlp-plugin). Add @tomorrow or read past journals and add @today. They become links.
 #### You can view completed tasks. ‚úÖ
 - Try using [Logseq task completion tracker plugin](https://github.com/DimitryDushkin/logseq-plugin-task-check-date).
#### You can link a reference and delete a block from the right-click context menu. üñ±Ô∏è

### Journal Queries

 - On Logseq, edit config.edn file. [For more details refer to this link](https://github.com/YU000jp/Logseq-default-queries-journals)

### Right Sidebar
 - Pages can be placed side by side in the sidebar.(Credit: [Logseq Vertical Panels for Sidebar](https://github.com/r-hegde/logseq-vertical-panels))
 - You can adjust the size by selecting the bottom right of the block. But don't make it too small.
 - Changed not to display page-tags and Hierarchy in the right sidebar. Clearly display the right sidebar.
 - If you have an ultrawide monitor, or if you want to display multiple screens side by side, you can display several pages side by side in right sidebar.

## Attention‚ö†Ô∏è
 - the screen min-width: 1850px
 - Some plugins are not supported. (Let me know on [GitHub](https://github.com/YU000jp/Logseq-column-Layout/issues).)
 - The Linked Reference space is blank if there are no tasks in Logseq.
 - Linked reference from journal are limited to dates other than today.

### The page other than journals
 - display "page-tags" and "page-hierarchy" ([logseq page-tags and hierarchy plugin](https://github.com/YU000jp/logseq-page-tags-and-hierarchy))
 - "Linked References" side by side (only Wide-mode). If the display space is small, hold down ‚å®Ô∏è"Shift" and click to open it in the right sidebar.
 - Wide mode(‚å®Ô∏èshortcut: „Äå**tw**„Äç) is recommended if you want to use Linked References side by side. Journals will be left justified.
