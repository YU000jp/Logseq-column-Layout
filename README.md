### Linked reference

#### Suitable for [Omnivore plugin](https://github.com/omnivore-app/logseq-omnivore)

- Omnivore is a **WebClipping tool** that can be quoted to Logseq.
- You can see the table of web clips for the day next to the journal, so it's easy to access. (View `substack.com` newsletter)

#### üìÖ As a list for inclusion in the next journal

- Use [datenlp plugin](https://github.com/hkgnp/logseq-datenlp-plugin). Add `@wednesday` or read past journals and add `@today`. They become links.

#### PDF highlights

- Logseq has the ability to read and highlight PDF file. If you add a date link to highlights, it will be included in the list of linked references.
