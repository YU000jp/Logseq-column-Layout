### Linked Reference
#### Suitable for [logseq Omnivore plugin](https://github.com/omnivore-app/logseq-omnivore) üö©
- Omnivore is a **webclipping tool** that can be quoted to Logseq.
- You can see the table of web clips for the day next to the journal, so it's easy to access. (View `substack.com` newsletter)
#### As a list for inclusion in the next journal üìÖ
 - Use [Logseq datenlp plugin](https://github.com/hkgnp/logseq-datenlp-plugin). Add `@wednesday` or read past journals and add `@today`. They become links.
 #### View completed tasks ‚úÖ
 - Try using [Logseq task completion tracker plugin](https://github.com/DimitryDushkin/logseq-plugin-task-check-date).

### Journal Queries
 - Change the journal query to get more task management.
 - On Logseq, edit `config.edn` file. [For more details refer to this link(sample code)](https://github.com/YU000jp/logseq-default-queries-journals)
